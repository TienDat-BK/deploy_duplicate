A multi-armed bandit with finitely many arms is studied when each arm is a homogeneous Markov process on an underlying finite state space. The transition law of one of the arms, referred to as the odd arm, is different from the common transition law of all other arms. A learner, who has no knowledge of the above transition laws, has to devise a sequential test to identify the index of the odd arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the probability of error. For this problem, we derive an asymptotic lower bound on the expected stopping time of any sequential test of the learner, where the asymptotics is as the probability of error vanishes. Furthermore, we propose a sequential test, and show that the asymptotic behaviour of its expected stopping time comes arbitrarily close to that of the lower bound. Prior works deal with independent and identically distributed arms, whereas our work deals with Markov arms. Our analysis of the rested Markov setting is a key first step in understanding the difficult case of restless Markov setting, which is still open.
We examined a multi-armed bandit with a limited number of arms, where each arm operates as a homogeneous Markov process on a finite state space. One of the arms, known as the odd arm, has a transition law that is different from the common transition law of the other arms. A learner, lacking knowledge of these transition laws, must create a sequential test to quickly identify the odd arm without exceeding a certain probability of error. We have established a minimum expected stopping time for any sequential test as the probability of error approaches zero. Additionally, we have proposed a sequential test whose expected stopping time closely approaches this minimum. While previous research has focused on independent and identically distributed arms, our work specifically addresses Markov arms. This analysis of the Markov setting is an essential initial step in understanding the more complex case of restless Markov settings, which remains unexplored.

 We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on ) require ( poly ( 1 neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with 1 ) require O ( polylog ( 1 neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on a simple observation: the multiplication of two bits can be represented by a ReLU.
 The rides will be free for now. People who want to sign-up for a ride can do so on Cruise's website, which is linked in the article. Cruise currently operates five of its robotaxis around certain parts of San Francisco between 10 PM and 6 AM. The vehicles are authorized to travel at a top speed of 30 MPH. Cruise plans to expand to more cities soon. A video from Cruise showing its first few riders experiencing the driverless robotaxis is available in the article.
 The device uses a patented electrospinning technology which creates nanofibers by applying a strong electric field to polymer solutions which then knit together in layers to form a nanofibrous mat that mimics skin. The polymer solution can be combined with antibacterial creams, antibiotics, collagen, silicon, hydrogel, or cannabinoids, depending on the patient's needs. Treatment is fast, and patients can take showers after only 2 days without the need to redress the wound. The device is set to launch in the second half of 2019.
 In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to explore why email spoofing is still possible after years of efforts to design, develop, and promote anti-spoofing protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Previous research shows that the adoption rates of anti-spoofing protocols are still very low. To understand the reasons behind the slow adoption, we conduct a user study with 9 email administrators from different institutions. The results show that email administrators are aware of the weaknesses of these protocols and believe the current protocol adoption lacks the crucial mass due to the protocol defects, weak incentives, and practical deployment challenges. Based on these results, we discuss the key implications to protocol designers, email providers and users, and future research directions to mitigate the email spoofing threats.
Motivated by the Internet-of-things and sensor networks for cyberphysical systems, the problem of dynamic sensor activation for the centralized tracking of an i.i.d. time-varying process is examined. The tradeoff is between energy efficiency, which decreases with the number of active sensors, and fidelity, which increases with the number of active sensors. The problem of minimizing the time-averaged mean-squared error over infinite horizon is examined under the constraint of the mean number of active sensors. The proposed methods artfully combine Gibbs sampling and stochastic approximation for learning, in order to create a high performance, energy efficient tracking mechanisms with active sensor selection. Centralized tracking of i.i.d. process with known distribution as well as an unknown parametric distribution are considered. For an i.i.d. process with known distribution, convergence to the global optimal solution with high probability is proved. The main challenge of the i.i.d. case is that the process has a distribution parameterized by a known or unknown parameter which must be learned; one key theoretical result proves that the proposed algorithm for tracking an i.i.d. process with unknown parametric distribution converges to local optima. Numerical results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and also suggest that global optimality is in fact achieved in some cases.
Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) systems track targets across cameras. Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually restrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera tracking, local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames; in multi-camera tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras that the target may appear successively. For similarity estimation, tracking systems often adopt appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) perspective. Different from tracking, re-ID usually does not have access to the trajectory cues that can limit the search space to a local neighborhood. Due to its global matching property, the re-ID perspective requires to learn global appearance features. We argue that the mismatch between the local matching procedure in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may compromise MTMCT performance. To fit the local matching procedure in MTMCT, in this work, we introduce locality aware appearance metric (LAAM). Specifically, we design an intra-camera metric for single camera tracking, and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking. Both metrics are trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods, as opposed to global sampling in the re-ID perspective. We show that the locally learned metrics can be successfully applied on top of several globally learned re-ID features. With the proposed method, we report new state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset, and a substantial improvement on the CityFlow dataset.
As a joke, Roy requested an unpopular song to the radio station. At first the DJ refused. Roy called back from different phones and disguised his voice. The DJ began to think that this song was actually worth playing. After the 25th call in, the DJ played the song for Roy.
 Consistency is defined with respect to strong simulation conformance. We propose learning algorithms that use traditional and a new stochastic state-space partitioning, the latter resulting in the minimum number of states. We then use them to solve the problem of active learning, that uses a knowledgeable teacher to generate samples as counterexamples to simulation equivalence queries. We show that the problem is undecidable in general, but that it becomes decidable under a suitable condition on the teacher which comes naturally from the way samples are generated from failed simulation checks. The latter problem is shown to be undecidable if we impose an additional condition on the learner to always conjecture a minimum state hypothesis. We therefore propose a semi-algorithm using stochastic partitions. Finally, we apply the proposed (semi algorithms to infer intermediate assumptions in an automated assume-guarantee verification framework for probabilistic systems.
 Employees of the superstore chain reported on Tuesday that they had been fired that day with zero notice. Some employees were tasked with shipping remaining merchandise back to suppliers for their last day of work. Fry's website has begun serving failure notices, but some of its subdomains remain active. The company has deleted its Facebook account and locked its Twitter profile. An official announcement is expected soon.
 A popular model for such problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors, and use composition functions (e.g. concatenation or sum) of those vectors as features for the prediction. At the same time, composition of embeddings has been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge base triples). In this article, we show that previous work on relation prediction between texts implicitly uses compositions from baseline SRL models. We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural language inference). We build on recent SRL models to address textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly improve the state of the art in both transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction.
 We are then able to employ attention-based NMT for many-to-many multilingual translation tasks. Our approach does not require any special treatment on the network architecture and it allows us to learn minimal number of free parameters in a standard way of training. Our approach has shown its effectiveness in an under-resourced translation scenario with considerable improvements up to 2.6 BLEU points. In addition, the approach has achieved interesting and promising results when applied in the translation task that there is no direct parallel corpus between source and target languages.

 Reservoir computing is a growing paradigm for simplified training of recurrent neural networks, with a high potential for hardware implementations. Numerous experiments in optics and electronics yield comparable performance to digital state-of-the-art algorithms. Many of the most recent works in the field focus on large-scale photonic systems, with tens of thousands of physical nodes and arbitrary interconnections. While this trend significantly expands the potential applications of photonic reservoir computing, it also complicates the optimisation of the high number of hyper hyp parameters of the system. Methods. In this work, we propose the use of Bayesian optimisation for efficient exploration of the hyper hyp parameter space in a minimum number of iteration. Results. We test this approach on a previously reported large-scale experimental system, compare it to the commonly used grid search, and report notable improvements in performance and the number of experimental iterations required to optimise the hyper hyp parameters. Conclusion. Bayesian optimisation thus has the potential to become the standard method for tuning the hyper hyp parameters in photonic reservoir computing.

Cruise, the self-driving car subsidiary of General Motors, is revolutionizing urban transportation by opening its driverless car service to the public in San Francisco. Known for its fleet of robotaxis that currently operates within select areas of the city, the company is expanding access as it moves from testing to broad deployment. This significant development marks a new chapter in autonomous vehicle (AV) integration into daily life, offering residents and visitors an innovative mobility option. Cruise's robotaxis have been roaming San Francisco streets for some time but were previously restricted to employees and private testers. With the latest announcement, this cutting-edge technology is now available for public use, promising safe, efficient, and convenient rides without a human driver behind the wheel. The move to allow public riders is a testament to Cruise's confidence in its technology and the extensive testing that its autonomous fleet has undergone.

Systems that track multiple targets across multiple cameras (MTMCT) monitor targets across different cameras. Tracking systems typically restrict their data association to a local area because of the continuity of target trajectories. The term "local neighborhood" refers to consecutive frames in single-camera tracking and neighboring cameras that the target may appear in successively in multi-camera tracking. Tracking systems frequently use appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) viewpoint to estimate similarity. Unlike tracking, re-ID does not usually have access to the trajectory cues that can restrict the search space to a local area. Because of its global matching characteristics, the re-ID viewpoint requires learning global appearance features. We contend that the disparity between the local matching process in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may impair MTMCT performance. In this study, we propose the locality-aware appearance metric (LAAM) to address this issue. Specifically, we create an intra-camera metric for single-camera tracking and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking. These metrics are trained using local neighborhood data pairs rather than global sampling used in the re-ID

In this study, we address the challenge of inducing a non-deterministic probabilistic tree automaton (NPTA) that accurately represents the stochastic regularities embedded within a finite corpus of tree-structured data. The proposed method seeks to generalize beyond the observed samples to potentially infinite sets of unseen instances by capturing the underlying probabilities governing the generation of the trees. We introduce a novel algorithmic framework that iteratively refines the NPTA by leveraging both positive examples, which are trees accepted by the system, and negative examples, which are trees that should be rejected. Our approach utilizes a combination of statistical inference techniques and heuristic-guided search to optimize the state transitions and probability distributions of the automaton. To evaluate our method's performance, we conduct experiments on synthetic datasets designed to simulate various complexities and stochastic behaviors of tree-generating processes. We also apply our framework to real-world datasets from natural language processing and bioinformatics to demonstrate its applicability to practical problems involving hierarchical data structures.

Embedding sentences is a common approach for modeling semantic relations between textual elements in NLP problems. By representing sentences as dense vectors in a continuous vector space, it allows for capturing the semantic meaning and relationships between them. This technique has been widely used for tasks such as predicting sentence similarity, entailment, and discourse relations. Various methods for sentence embedding have been proposed, including neural network-based models and pre-trained word embeddings. These approaches have shown promising results in capturing the nuanced semantic relations between textual elements, making them valuable tools for a wide range of NLP applications.

Our proposed approach leverages the strengths of state-of-the-art NMT models, while simultaneously addressing the limitations of traditional multilingual translation frameworks. By integrating a shared encoder and language-specific decoders, we enable the efficient translation of multiple languages within a single model. Our experiments show promising results in various language pairs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our unified approach in comparison to traditional cascading and direct translation methods. Further explorations include optimizing the shared encoder for improved language coverage and investigating the potential of incorporating additional linguistic features."

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in large scale photonic systems due to their potential applications in telecommunications, data processing, and sensing. These systems typically consist of a large number of interconnected photonic devices, such as lasers, modulators, and detectors, that operate in unison to perform complex functions. The ability to scale these systems to hundreds or even thousands of elements presents both opportunities and challenges in terms of design, control, and integration. In this paper, we review recent advances in the development of large scale photonic systems and discuss the key technical and practical considerations in their implementation. We also highlight potential applications and future directions for this exciting field of research.
