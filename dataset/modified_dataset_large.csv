"A multi-armed bandit with finitely many arms is studied when each arm is a homogeneous Markov process on an underlying finite state space. The transition law of one of the arms, referred to as the odd arm, is different from the common transition law of all other arms. A learner, who has no knowledge of the above transition laws, has to devise a sequential test to identify the index of the odd arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the probability of error. For this problem, we derive an asymptotic lower bound on the expected stopping time of any sequential test of the learner, where the asymptotics is as the probability of error vanishes. Furthermore, we propose a sequential test, and show that the asymptotic behaviour of its expected stopping time comes arbitrarily close to that of the lower bound. Prior works deal with independent and identically distributed arms, whereas our work deals with Markov arms. Our analysis of the rested Markov setting is a key first step in understanding the difficult case of restless Markov setting, which is still open."

" We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on ) require ( poly ( 1 neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with 1 ) require O ( polylog ( 1 neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on a simple observation: the multiplication of two bits can be represented by a ReLU."

" The device uses a patented electrospinning technology which creates nanofibers by applying a strong electric field to polymer solutions which then knit together in layers to form a nanofibrous mat that mimics skin. The polymer solution can be combined with antibacterial creams, antibiotics, collagen, silicon, hydrogel, or cannabinoids, depending on the patient's needs. Treatment is fast, and patients can take showers after only 2 days without the need to redress the wound. The device is set to launch in the second half of 2019."
" In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to explore why email spoofing is still possible after years of efforts to design, develop, and promote anti-spoofing protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Previous research shows that the adoption rates of anti-spoofing protocols are still very low. To understand the reasons behind the slow adoption, we conduct a user study with 9 email administrators from different institutions. The results show that email administrators are aware of the weaknesses of these protocols and believe the current protocol adoption lacks the crucial mass due to the protocol defects, weak incentives, and practical deployment challenges. Based on these results, we discuss the key implications to protocol designers, email providers and users, and future research directions to mitigate the email spoofing threats."
"Motivated by the Internet-of-things and sensor networks for cyberphysical systems, the problem of dynamic sensor activation for the centralized tracking of an i.i.d. time-varying process is examined. The tradeoff is between energy efficiency, which decreases with the number of active sensors, and fidelity, which increases with the number of active sensors. The problem of minimizing the time-averaged mean-squared error over infinite horizon is examined under the constraint of the mean number of active sensors. The proposed methods artfully combine Gibbs sampling and stochastic approximation for learning, in order to create a high performance, energy efficient tracking mechanisms with active sensor selection. Centralized tracking of i.i.d. process with known distribution as well as an unknown parametric distribution are considered. For an i.i.d. process with known distribution, convergence to the global optimal solution with high probability is proved. The main challenge of the i.i.d. case is that the process has a distribution parameterized by a known or unknown parameter which must be learned; one key theoretical result proves that the proposed algorithm for tracking an i.i.d. process with unknown parametric distribution converges to local optima. Numerical results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and also suggest that global optimality is in fact achieved in some cases."
"Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) systems track targets across cameras. Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually restrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera tracking, local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames; in multi-camera tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras that the target may appear successively. For similarity estimation, tracking systems often adopt appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) perspective. Different from tracking, re-ID usually does not have access to the trajectory cues that can limit the search space to a local neighborhood. Due to its global matching property, the re-ID perspective requires to learn global appearance features. We argue that the mismatch between the local matching procedure in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may compromise MTMCT performance. To fit the local matching procedure in MTMCT, in this work, we introduce locality aware appearance metric (LAAM). Specifically, we design an intra-camera metric for single camera tracking, and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking. Both metrics are trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods, as opposed to global sampling in the re-ID perspective. We show that the locally learned metrics can be successfully applied on top of several globally learned re-ID features. With the proposed method, we report new state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset, and a substantial improvement on the CityFlow dataset."

" Consistency is defined with respect to strong simulation conformance. We propose learning algorithms that use traditional and a new stochastic state-space partitioning, the latter resulting in the minimum number of states. We then use them to solve the problem of active learning, that uses a knowledgeable teacher to generate samples as counterexamples to simulation equivalence queries. We show that the problem is undecidable in general, but that it becomes decidable under a suitable condition on the teacher which comes naturally from the way samples are generated from failed simulation checks. The latter problem is shown to be undecidable if we impose an additional condition on the learner to always conjecture a minimum state hypothesis. We therefore propose a semi-algorithm using stochastic partitions. Finally, we apply the proposed (semi algorithms to infer intermediate assumptions in an automated assume-guarantee verification framework for probabilistic systems."

" A popular model for such problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors, and use composition functions (e.g. concatenation or sum) of those vectors as features for the prediction. At the same time, composition of embeddings has been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge base triples). In this article, we show that previous work on relation prediction between texts implicitly uses compositions from baseline SRL models. We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural language inference). We build on recent SRL models to address textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly improve the state of the art in both transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction."
" We are then able to employ attention-based NMT for many-to-many multilingual translation tasks. Our approach does not require any special treatment on the network architecture and it allows us to learn minimal number of free parameters in a standard way of training. Our approach has shown its effectiveness in an under-resourced translation scenario with considerable improvements up to 2.6 BLEU points. In addition, the approach has achieved interesting and promising results when applied in the translation task that there is no direct parallel corpus between source and target languages."

" Reservoir computing is a growing paradigm for simplified training of recurrent neural networks, with a high potential for hardware implementations. Numerous experiments in optics and electronics yield comparable performance to digital state-of-the-art algorithms. Many of the most recent works in the field focus on large-scale photonic systems, with tens of thousands of physical nodes and arbitrary interconnections. While this trend significantly expands the potential applications of photonic reservoir computing, it also complicates the optimisation of the high number of hyper hyp parameters of the system. Methods. In this work, we propose the use of Bayesian optimisation for efficient exploration of the hyper hyp parameter space in a minimum number of iteration. Results. We test this approach on a previously reported large-scale experimental system, compare it to the commonly used grid search, and report notable improvements in performance and the number of experimental iterations required to optimise the hyper hyp parameters. Conclusion. Bayesian optimisation thus has the potential to become the standard method for tuning the hyper hyp parameters in photonic reservoir computing."

"Recently, multidimensional signal reconstruction using a low number of measurements is of great interest. Therefore, an effective sampling scheme which should acquire the most information of signal using a low number of measurements is required. In this paper, we study a novel cube-based method for sampling and reconstruction of multidimensional signals. First, inspired by the block-based compressive sensing (BCS), we divide a group of pictures (GoP) in a video sequence into cubes. By this way, we can easily store the measurement matrix and also easily can generate the sparsifying basis. The reconstruction process also can be done in parallel. Second, along with the Kronecker structure of the sampling matrix, we design a weight matrix based on the human visuality system, i.e. perceptually. We will also benefit from different weighted 1 -minimization methods for reconstruction. Furthermore, conventional methods for BCS consider an equal number of samples for all blocks. However, the sparsity order of blocks in natural images could be different and, therefore, a various number of samples could be required for their reconstruction. Motivated by this point, we will adaptively allocate the samples for each cube in a video sequence. Our aim is to show that our simple linear sampling approach can be competitive with the other state-of-the-art methods."
"Cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has become the gold standard for the non-invasive evaluation of cardiac function. In particular, it allows the accurate quantification of functional parameters including the chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning has shown the potential to automate the requisite cardiac structure segmentation. However, the lack of robustness of deep learning models has hindered their widespread clinical adoption. Due to differences in the data characteristics, neural networks trained on data from a specific scanner are not guaranteed to generalise well to data acquired at a different centre or with a different scanner. In this work, we propose a principled solution to the problem of this domain shift. Domain-adversarial learning is used to train a domain-invariant 2D U-Net using labelled and unlabelled data. This approach is evaluated on both seen and unseen domains from the MMs challenge dataset and the domain-adversarial approach shows improved performance as compared to standard training. Additionally, we show that the domain information cannot be recovered from the learned features."

"Air-gapped systems are systems that aren't connected to any network. These systems generally run critical operations or have sensitive data, so limiting exposure to outside networks is a necessary security measure. Mordechai Guri and his team have been researching methods of extracting data from air-gapped systems and have developed a plethora of techniques over the years. A new technique involves installing malware onto the air-gapped machine which makes the fans inside the computer vibrate at certain frequencies. These frequencies can be recorded using a phone's accelerometer and then decoded later on. While the technique is innovative, it is extremely slow, extracting data at half a bit per second. Real-life attackers are likely to use faster methods."
" However, recent studies demonstrate that, when equipped with expressive generative distributions (aka. decoders), VAE suffers from learning uninformative latent representations with the observation called KL Varnishing , in which case VAE collapses into an unconditional generative model. In this work, we introduce mutual posterior-divergence regularization , a novel regularization that is able to control the geometry of the latent space to accomplish meaningful representation learning, while achieving comparable or superior capability of density estimation. Experiments on three image benchmark datasets demonstrate that, when equipped with powerful decoders, our model performs well both on density estimation and representation learning."

"We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods to multiple agents. Recent work focused on allocating goods in a sequential way, and studied what is the ""best"" sequence of agents to pick objects based on utilitarian or egalitarian criterion. In this paper, we propose a parallel elicitation-free protocol for allocating indivisible goods. In every round of the allocation process, some agents will be selected (according to some policy) to report their preferred objects among those that remain, and every reported object will be allocated randomly to an agent reporting it. Empirical comparison between the parallel protocol (applying a simple selection policy) and the sequential protocol (applying the optimal sequence) reveals that our proposed protocol is promising. We also address strategical issues."

" Inspired by the topical correspondence between mathematical equations and word contexts observed in scientific texts, we propose a novel topic model that jointly generates mathematical equations and their surrounding text (TopicEq). Using an extension of the correlated topic model, the context is generated from a mixture of latent topics, and the equation is generated by an RNN that depends on the latent topic activations. To experiment with this model, we create a corpus of 400K equation-context pairs extracted from a range of scientific articles from arXiv, and fit the model using a variational autoencoder approach. Experimental results show that this joint model significantly outperforms existing topic models and equation models for scientific texts. Moreover, we qualitatively show that the model effectively captures the relationship between topics and mathematics, enabling novel applications such as topic-aware equation generation, equation topic inference, and topic-aware alignment of mathematical symbols and words."

"We present a novel approach of creating face makeup upon a face image with another images as the style examples. Our approach is analogous to physical makeup, as we modify the color and skin details while preserving the face structure. More precisely, we extract image foregrounds from both subject and multiple example images. Then by using image matting algorithms, the system extracts the semantic information such as faces, lips, teeth, eyes, eyebrows, etc., from the extracted foregrounds of both subject and multiple example images. And, then the makeup style is transferred between the corresponding parts with the same semantic information. Next we get the face makeup transferred result by seamlessly compositing different parts together using alpha blending. In the final step, we present an efficient method of makeup consistency to optimize the color of a collection of images showing the common scene. The main advantage of our method over existing techniques is that it does not need face matching, as one could use more than one example images. Because one example image does not fulfill the complete requirements of a user. Our algorithm is not restricted to head shot images as we can also change the makeup style in the wild. Moreover, our algorithm does not require to choose the same pose and image size between subject and example images. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in faithfully transferring makeup."

" Supervised machine learning enables the detection and exploitation of findings that are known a priori after annotation of training examples by experts. However, supervision does not scale well, due to the amount of necessary training examples, and the limitation of the marker vocabulary to known entities. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose unsupervised identification of anomalies as candidates for markers in retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging data without a constraint to a priori definitions. We identify and categorize marker candidates occurring frequently in the data, and demonstrate that these markers show predictive value in the task of detecting disease. A careful qualitative analysis of the identified data driven markers reveals how their quantifiable occurrence aligns with our current understanding of disease course, in early- and late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients. A multi-scale deep denoising autoencoder is trained on healthy images, and a one-class support vector machine identifies anomalies in new data. Clustering in the anomalies identifies stable categories. Using these markers to classify healthy-, early AMD- and late AMD cases yields an accuracy of 81.40. In a second binary classification experiment on a publicly available data set (healthy vs. intermediate AMD) the model achieves an AUC of 0.944."

" By a theorem of McNaughton and Papert, these are also the first-order definable languages. The dot-depth rose to prominence following the work of Thomas, who proved an exact correspondence with the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth hierarchy consists of all languages that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in automata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for each level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs to this level? Despite a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been solved for low levels. A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing membership with a more general problem: separation . Given two input languages, one has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated level containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The motivation for looking at separation is threefold: (1) while more difficult, it is more rewarding, as solving it requires a better understanding; (2) being more general, it provides a more convenient framework, and (3) all recent membership algorithms are actually reductions to separation for lower levels. We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two. A key point is that while dot-depth two is our most prominent application, our theorem is more general. We consider a family of hierarchies, which includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They are built through a generic construction process: one first chooses an initial class, the basis, which serves as the lowest level in the hierarchy. Then, further levels are built by applying generic operations. Our main theorem states that for any concatenation hierarchy whose basis consists of finitely many languages, separation is decidable for level one. In the special case of the dot-depth, this can be lifted to level two using previously known results."

" We consider a slotted-mode of operation where each slot of SU is used for either energy harvesting or data transmission. Considering block fading with memory, we model the energy arrival and fading processes as a stationary Markov process of first order. We propose a harvest-or-transmit policy for the SU along with optimal transmit powers that maximize its expected throughput under three different settings. First, we consider a learning-theoretic approach where we do not assume any apriori knowledge about the underlying Markov processes. In this case, we obtain an online policy using Q-learning . Then, we assume that the full statistical knowledge of the governing Markov process is known apriori. Under this assumption, we obtain an optimal online policy using infinite horizon stochastic dynamic programming . Finally, we obtain an optimal offline policy using the generalized Benders decomposition algorithm. The offline policy assumes that for a given time deadline, the energy arrivals and channel states are known in advance at all the transmitters. Finally, we compare all policies and study the effects of various system parameters on the system performance."

"Researchers at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered a way to transform a substance found in fossil fuels into diamonds with pressure and low heat. Diamond synthesis usually requires a large amount of energy, time, or the addition of a catalyst, which adds impurities. Diamondoids are tiny, odorless, and slightly sticky powders that resemble rock salt. They are made up of atoms arranged in the same pattern as diamonds, but they contain hydrogen. Diamondoids can reorganize into diamonds with surprisingly little energy, without passing through other forms of carbon, such as graphite. The method is currently only able to make specks of diamonds, and it is impractical until larger crystals can be formed."

Domain Specific Languages are used to provide a tailored modelling notation for a specific application domain. There are currently two main approaches to DSLs: standard notations that are tailored by adding simple properties; new notations that are designed from scratch. There are problems with both of these approaches which can be addressed by providing access to a small meta-language based on packages and classes. A meta-modelling approach based on meta-packages allows a wide range of DSLs to be defined in a standard way. The DSLs can be processed using standard object-based extension at the meta-level and existing tooling can easily be defined to adapt to the new languages. This paper introduces the concept of meta-packages and provides a simple example.
" Both supervised techniques (naive Bayesian classifier (NBC), decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR and unsupervised algorithm (hidden markov model (HMM are studied to find the best technique with the highest classification accuracy (CA). A detailed comparison of the supervised and unsupervised algorithms in terms of the computational time and classification accuracy is performed. The classified occupancy status is further utilized to evaluate the probability of secondary user outage for the future time slots, which can be used by system designers to define spectrum allocation and spectrum sharing policies.

"Supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms are aimed at maximizing classification performance under available energy and storage constraints. They try to map the training data to the corresponding labels while ensuring generalizability to unseen data. However, they do not integrate meaning-based relationships among labels in the decision process. On the other hand, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms emphasize the importance of semantic information. In this paper, we synthesize the complementary advantages of supervised ML and natural language processing algorithms into one method that we refer to as SECRET (Semantically Enhanced Classification of REal-world Tasks). SECRET performs classifications by fusing the semantic information of the labels with the available data: it combines the feature space of the supervised algorithms with the semantic space of the NLP algorithms and predicts labels based on this joint space. Experimental results indicate that, compared to traditional supervised learning, SECRET achieves up to 13.9 accuracy and 13.5 F1 score improvements. Moreover, compared to ensemble methods, SECRET achieves up to 12.6 accuracy and 13.8 F1 score improvements. This points to a new research direction for supervised classification by incorporating semantic information."

"State-of-the-art pedestrian detection models have achieved great success in many benchmarks. However, these models require lots of annotation information and the labeling process usually takes much time and efforts. In this paper, we propose a method to generate labeled pedestrian data and adopt them to support the training of pedestrian detectors. The proposed framework is built on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with multiple discriminators, trying to synthesize realistic pedestrians and learn the background context simultaneously. To handle the pedestrians of different sizes, we adopt the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer in the discriminator. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks. The results show that our framework can smoothly synthesize pedestrians on background images of variations and different levels of details. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, we add the generated samples into training data of the baseline pedestrian detectors and show the synthetic images are able to improve the detectors' performance. 1 1 footnote 1 the code is available at"
"Despite many recent advances for the design of dialogue systems, a true bottleneck remains the acquisition of data required to train its components. Unlike many other language processing applications, dialogue systems require interactions with users, therefore it is complex to develop them with pre-recorded data. Building on previous works, on-line learning is pursued here as a most convenient way to address the issue. Data collection, annotation and use in learning algorithms are performed in a single process. The main difficulties are then: to bootstrap an initial basic system, and to control the level of additional cost on the user side. Considering that well-performing solutions can be used directly off the shelf for speech recognition and synthesis, the study is focused on learning the spoken language understanding and dialogue management modules only. Several variants of joint learning are investigated and tested with user trials to confirm that the overall on-line learning can be obtained after only a few hundred training dialogues and can overstep an expert-based system."
"A likelihood encoder is studied in the context of lossy source compression. The analysis of the likelihood encoder is based on the soft-covering lemma. It is demonstrated that the use of a likelihood encoder together with the soft-covering lemma yields simple achievability proofs for classical source coding problems. The cases of the point-to-point rate-distortion function, the rate-distortion function with side information at the decoder (i.e. the Wyner-Ziv problem), and the multi-terminal source coding inner bound (i.e. the Berger-Tung problem) are examined in this paper. Furthermore, a non-asymptotic analysis is used for the point-to-point case to examine the upper bound on the excess distortion provided by this method. The likelihood encoder is also related to a recent alternative technique using properties of random binning."

" In this paper, we model such a two-layer heterogenous network based on stochastic geometry approach. We aim at minimizing the expected power consumption of the D2D layer while satisfying the outage performance of both D2D layer and cellular layer. We consider two kinds of power control schemes. The first one is referred as to independent power control where the transmit powers are statistically independent of the networks and all channel conditions. The second is named as dependent power control where the transmit power of each user is dependent on its own channel condition. A closed-form expression of optimal independent power control is derived, and we point out that the optimal power control for this case is fixed and not relevant to the randomness of the network. For the dependent power control case, we propose an efficient way to find the close-to-optimal solution for the power-efficiency optimization problem. Numerical results show that dependent power control scheme saves about half of power that the independent power control scheme demands."

"The main objective of this paper is to define a logic for reasoning about distributed time-stamped claims. Such a logic is interesting for theoretical reasons, i.e., as a logic per se , but also because it has a number of practical applications, in particular when one needs to reason about a huge amount of pieces of evidence collected from different sources, where some of the pieces of evidence may be contradictory and some sources are considered to be more trustworthy than others. We introduce the Time-Stamped Claim Logic including a sound and complete sequent calculus that allows one to reduce the size of the collected set of evidence and removes inconsistencies, i.e., the logic ensures that the result is consistent with respect to the trust relations considered. In order to show how Time-Stamped Claim Logic can be used in practice, we consider a concrete cyber-attribution case study. Keywords: Time-stamped claim logic, labelled deduction, Gentzen calculus, evidence logic, cyber security."

"Process mining techniques focus on extracting insight in processes from event logs. Process mining has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un) healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions when applied on data from smart home environments. However, events recorded in smart home environments are on the level of sensor triggers, at which process discovery algorithms produce overgeneralizing process models that allow for too much behavior and that are difficult to interpret for human experts. We show that abstracting the events to a higher-level interpretation can enable discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework for the extraction of features that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods that is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. This framework can automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level, after training it on training data for which both the sensor and human activity events are known. We demonstrate our abstraction framework on three real-life smart home event logs and show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction are more precise indeed."
"This paper is on highly accurate and highly efficient human pose estimation. Recent works based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) have demonstrated excellent results for this difficult problem. While residual connections within FCNs have proved to be quintessential for achieving high accuracy, we re-analyze this design choice in the context of improving both the accuracy and the efficiency over the state-of-the-art. In particular, we make the following contributions: (a) We propose gated skip connections with per-channel learnable parameters to control the data flow for each channel within the module within the macro-module. (b) We introduce a hybrid network that combines the HourGlass and U-Net architectures which minimizes the number of identity connections within the network and increases the performance for the same parameter budget. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPII and LSP datasets. In addition, with a reduction of 3 in model size and complexity, we show no decrease in performance when compared to the original HourGlass network."
Nanoscale devices can be difficult to study and improve as they're too small to reflect enough light to be viewed clearly. Researchers from UC Riverside have built a device that squeezes tungsten lamp light into a 6-nanometer spot at the end of a silver nanowire to produce color imaging at an unprecedented level. The system records changes in beam shape and color as the nanowire's tip passes over objects. It is able to create color photos of carbon nanotubes. The technology could play an important role in developing more uniform nanomaterials and help improve other areas of research where this level of resolution hasn't been available.
"Consider the following problem. A seller has infinite copies of n products represented by nodes in a graph. There are m consumers, each has a budget and wants to buy two products. Consumers are represented by weighted edges. Given the prices of products, each consumer will buy both products she wants, at the given price, if she can afford to. Our objective is to help the seller price the products to maximize her profit. This problem is called graph vertex pricing (GVP) problem and has resisted several recent attempts despite its current simple solution. This motivates the study of this problem on special classes of graphs. In this paper, we study this problem on a large class of graphs such as graphs with bounded treewidth, bounded genus and k -partite graphs. We show that there exists an FPTAS for GVP on graphs with bounded treewidth. This result is also extended to an FPTAS for the more general single-minded pricing problem. On bounded genus graphs we present a PTAS and show that GVP is NP -hard even on planar graphs. We study the Sherali-Adams hierarchy applied to a natural Integer Program formulation that ( 1 ) -approximates the optimal solution of GVP . Sherali-Adams hierarchy has gained much interest recently as a possible approach to develop new approximation algorithms. We show that, when the input graph has bounded treewidth or bounded genus, applying a constant number of rounds of Sherali-Adams hierarchy makes the integrality gap of this natural LP arbitrarily small, thus giving a ( 1 ) -approximate solution to the original GVP instance. On k -partite graphs, we present a constant-factor approximation algorithm. We further improve the approximation factors for paths, cycles and graphs with degree at most three."

" The identifier measurements during authentication are assumed to be controllable via a cost-constrained ""action"" sequence. Single-letter characterizations of the optimal trade-off among the secret-key rate, storage rate, privacy-leakage rate, and action cost are given for the four problems where noisy or noiseless measurements of the source are enrolled to generate or embed secret keys. The results are relevant for several user-authentication scenarios including physical and biometric authentications with multiple measurements. Our results include, as special cases, new results for secret-key generation and embedding with action-dependent side information without any privacy constraint on the enrolled source sequence."
"We examined a multi-armed bandit with a limited number of arms, where each arm operates as a homogeneous Markov process on a finite state space. One of the arms, known as the odd arm, has a transition law that is different from the common transition law of the other arms. A learner, lacking knowledge of these transition laws, must create a sequential test to quickly identify the odd arm without exceeding a certain probability of error. We have established a minimum expected stopping time for any sequential test as the probability of error approaches zero. Additionally, we have proposed a sequential test whose expected stopping time closely approaches this minimum. While previous research has focused on independent and identically distributed arms, our work specifically addresses Markov arms. This analysis of the Markov setting is an essential initial step in understanding the more complex case of restless Markov settings, which remains unexplored."

" We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on ) require ( poly ( 1 neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with 1 ) require O ( polylog ( 1 neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on a simple observation: the multiplication of two bits can be represented by a ReLU."

" In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to explore why email spoofing is still possible after years of efforts to design, develop, and promote anti-spoofing protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Previous research shows that the adoption rates of anti-spoofing protocols are still very low. To understand the reasons behind the slow adoption, we conduct a user study with 9 email administrators from different institutions. The results show that email administrators are aware of the weaknesses of these protocols and believe the current protocol adoption lacks the crucial mass due to the protocol defects, weak incentives, and practical deployment challenges. Based on these results, we discuss the key implications to protocol designers, email providers and users, and future research directions to mitigate the email spoofing threats."

"Systems that track multiple targets across multiple cameras (MTMCT) monitor targets across different cameras. Tracking systems typically restrict their data association to a local area because of the continuity of target trajectories. The term ""local neighborhood"" refers to consecutive frames in single-camera tracking and neighboring cameras that the target may appear in successively in multi-camera tracking. Tracking systems frequently use appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) viewpoint to estimate similarity. Unlike tracking, re-ID does not usually have access to the trajectory cues that can restrict the search space to a local area. Because of its global matching characteristics, the re-ID viewpoint requires learning global appearance features. We contend that the disparity between the local matching process in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may impair MTMCT performance. In this study, we propose the locality-aware appearance metric (LAAM) to address this issue. Specifically, we create an intra-camera metric for single-camera tracking and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking. These metrics are trained using local neighborhood data pairs rather than global sampling used in the re-ID"

"In this study, we address the challenge of inducing a non-deterministic probabilistic tree automaton (NPTA) that accurately represents the stochastic regularities embedded within a finite corpus of tree-structured data. The proposed method seeks to generalize beyond the observed samples to potentially infinite sets of unseen instances by capturing the underlying probabilities governing the generation of the trees. We introduce a novel algorithmic framework that iteratively refines the NPTA by leveraging both positive examples, which are trees accepted by the system, and negative examples, which are trees that should be rejected. Our approach utilizes a combination of statistical inference techniques and heuristic-guided search to optimize the state transitions and probability distributions of the automaton. To evaluate our method's performance, we conduct experiments on synthetic datasets designed to simulate various complexities and stochastic behaviors of tree-generating processes. We also apply our framework to real-world datasets from natural language processing and bioinformatics to demonstrate its applicability to practical problems involving hierarchical data structures. Metrics of interest"

"Embedding sentences is a common approach for modeling semantic relations between textual elements in NLP problems. By representing sentences as dense vectors in a continuous vector space, it allows for capturing the semantic meaning and relationships between them. This technique has been widely used for tasks such as predicting sentence similarity, entailment, and discourse relations. Various methods for sentence embedding have been proposed, including neural network-based models and pre-trained word embeddings. These approaches have shown promising results in capturing the nuanced semantic relations between textual elements, making them valuable tools for a wide range of NLP applications."

"In a surprising display of prosocial behavior, the chimpanzees of the Rekambo community, located in the lush rainforests of Gabon, West Africa, have demonstrated what appears to be a rudimentary form of medicinal treatment by using insects for their wound-healing properties. Researchers observing these primates were stunned to witness the apes carefully selecting and applying live insects directly to their open wounds and even to the wounds of other chimps within their community. This remarkable behavior suggests a level of empathy and understanding previously not documented in wild chimpanzee groups. The act of attending to the injuries of their peers not only showcases their prosocial disposition but also highlights their capacity for complex thinking and problem-solving, hitherto believed to be a predominantly human trait."
"Recently, multidimensional signal reconstruction using a low number of measurements is of great interest. Therefore, an effective sampling scheme which should acquire the most information of signal using a low number of measurements is required. In this paper, we study a novel cube-based method for sampling and reconstruction of multidimensional signals. First, inspired by the block-based compressive sensing (BCS), we divide a group of pictures (GoP) in a video sequence into cubes. By this way, we can easily store the measurement matrix and also easily can generate the sparsifying basis. The reconstruction process also can be done in parallel. Second, along with the Kronecker structure of the sampling matrix, we design a weight matrix based on the human visuality system, i.e. perceptually. We will also benefit from different weighted 1 -minimization methods for reconstruction. Furthermore, conventional methods for BCS consider an equal number of samples for all blocks. However, the sparsity order of blocks in natural images could be different and, therefore, a various number of samples could be required for their reconstruction. Motivated by this point, we will adaptively allocate the samples for each cube in a video sequence. Our aim is to show that our simple linear sampling approach can be competitive with the other state-of-the-art methods."
"Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become the standard method for non-invasive assessment of cardiac function, allowing for precise measurement of functional parameters such as chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning has the potential to automate the segmentation of cardiac structures, but the lack of robustness in deep learning models has limited their widespread use in clinical settings. Neural networks trained on data from one scanner may not perform well on data from a different scanner due to differences in data characteristics. In this study, we propose a solution to this problem using domain-adversarial learning to train a domain-invariant 2D U-Net using both labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach demonstrates improved performance compared to standard training when evaluated on data from both familiar and unfamiliar domains, and we also demonstrate that the domain information cannot be recovered from the learned features."

In order to solve these NLP problems, we aim to learn a robust representation of text that captures the underlying semantic relations. Previous work has focused on embedding sentences in a high-dimensional vector space, where similarity between vectors corresponds to similarity in meaning. However, these vector-based models are limited in their ability to capture complex relationships between sentences, such as entailment and contradiction. We propose a novel approach that leverages the power of natural language inference (NLI) to model semantic relations between sentences. NLI is the task of determining the relationship between two sentences, such as entailment, contradiction, or neutral. By training a neural network to perform NLI, we can learn a rich representation of text that captures the nuances of semantic relationships. Our approach consists of two main components: a sentence encoder and an NLI classifier. The sentence encoder maps each sentence to a dense vector in a high-dimensional space,"

"We introduce a new method for applying makeup to a face image using other images as style references. Our approach mimics physical makeup by adjusting color and skin details while preserving the structure of the face. First, we extract the foreground from both the subject and multiple example images, and then use image matting algorithms to extract semantic information such as faces, lips, teeth, eyes, eyebrows, etc. Once the semantic information is extracted, we transfer the makeup style between corresponding parts. The final step involves seamlessly blending different parts together using alpha blending and optimizing the color consistency of a collection of images. Our method has the advantage of not requiring face matching and can utilize multiple example images to fulfill user requirements. Additionally, it is not limited to head shot images and can handle makeup style changes in different scenarios without the need for the same pose or image size. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in faithfully transferring makeup."

"In this context, we propose a novel energy harvesting protocol for the SU that maximizes the utilization of ambient energy sources while ensuring minimal interference with the primary user (PU) network operations. Our protocol employs a dynamic spectrum access strategy, which allows the SU to adapt its transmission power and frequency based on the PU's activity and the availability of harvested energy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, we develop a mathematical model that captures the stochastic nature of both the energy harvesting process and the PU's activity. We then derive the optimal policy for the SU that maximizes its throughput while satisfying interference constraints with respect to the PU. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly improves the energy efficiency and throughput of the SU compared to conventional fixed-spectrum access schemes. Moreover, the results indicate that our protocol maintains the required quality of service for the PU, thereby validating its potential for practical deployment in underlay cognitive radio networks. Our findings suggest that energy-efficient, adaptive spectrum management is a viable solution for the future"

However, these models require lots of annotation information and the labeling process usually takes much time and efforts. In this paper, we propose a method to generate labeled pedestrian data and adopt them to support the training of pedestrian detectors. Our proposed framework is built on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with multiple discriminators, trying to synthesize realistic pedestrians and learn the background context simultaneously. To handle the pedestrians of different sizes, we adopt the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer in the discriminator. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks. The results show that our framework can smoothly synthesize pedestrians on background images of variations and different levels of details. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, we add the generated samples into training data of the baseline pedestrian detectors and show the synthetic images are able to improve the detectors' performance."

However, D2D communication as an underlay network faces a challenge of sharing the same independent channel with cellular networks, which could result in interference and resource competition. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach of time-frequency resource allocation which ensures the coexistence of D2D communication with cellular networks. The proposed approach utilizes advanced signal processing techniques such as beamforming to mitigate interference and enable efficient sharing of resources. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using simulations and compare it with existing approaches. Our results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the system performance in terms of throughput and reduces the interference between D2D communication and cellular networks. It also enhances the quality of service (QoS) for D2D communication and ensures reliable data transmission. Overall, the proposed approach provides a promising solution for the coexistence of D2"

"Process mining techniques aim to extract insights from event logs about how things are done. When applied to data from smart home environments, process mining has the potential to provide valuable insights into both healthy and unhealthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions. However, the events recorded in smart home environments are on the level of sensor triggers, which causes process discovery algorithms to produce overly general process models that allow for too much behavior and are difficult for human experts to interpret. We demonstrate that raising the level of event interpretation can enable the discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework for feature extraction that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods and is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. This framework can automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level after being trained on training data that includes both the sensor and human activity events. Our abstraction framework is demonstrated on three real-life smart home event logs, and the results show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction are indeed more precise."

Our approach ensures that the tags cannot be generated without knowledge of the secret key, and that the tags are robust against any tampering with the source sequence. We evaluate the performance of our approach through simulations and show that it achieves high accuracy in detecting tampering while maintaining the privacy of the source sequence."
